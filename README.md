# Autoradio

autoradio is an openly configurable artificially intelligent radio DJ

Extend the [Spicetify client for Spofity](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify) to listen along to the radio with an AI powered DJ that will give you more details about the songs you've listend than just their title and artist. 

## Details

Spotify has recently implemented its own version of an AI radio DJ, but Bunkbed is of the opinion that it can be greatly improved.

- Stop audio playback to inform the listener of previous listened tracks and what's coming up next
- Give the listener background information about the song or artist, based on what it can glean from using free LLM APIs
- Allow for users to tweak the playback algorithm
- Use Spicetify's ability to list songs characteristics such as BPM and genre to build a custom playback algorithm
