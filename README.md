# Autoradio

Autoradio is a [spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify) extension that reminds you what you have been listening to most recently with real-time audio interruptions akin to a radio host.

Spotify has recently implemented its own version of an AI Radio DJ, but Bunkbed is of the opinion that it can be greatly improved.

## Features to Implement

- Stop audio playback to inform the listener of previous listened tracks and what's coming up next
- Give the listener background information about the song or artist, based on what it can glean from using free LLM APIs
- Allow for users to tweak the playback algorithm
- Use Spicetify's ability to list songs characteristics such as BPM and genre to build a custom playback algorithm
